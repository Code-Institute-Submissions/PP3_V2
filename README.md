# Battleships Game

Battleships is a Python-based terminal game where players engage in a battle against the computer. The objective is to sink all three of the opponent's ships on the playboard. Each player has 10 turns to make their shots by guessing coordinates. This game is hosted on the Code Institute's mock terminal on Heroku.
